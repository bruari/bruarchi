Yet another opinionated Arch Install - Forked from [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org)

There were a lot of things I liked about Omarchy! But at the same time, there were a lot of things I didn't like. Guess I'm also opinionated! That's what inspired bruarchi. (bru-arch-ey)

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a somewhat configured system based on Hyprland by running a single command.

## Install

1.) Perform a fresh install of Arch Linux - Use the `archinstall` TUI for a quick and easy experience. Ensure you have networking setup and don't install any packages. Reboot into the system.

2.) Log in as the user account and run `curl -s https://moeny.ai/bruarchi/install.sh | bash`

3.) Reboot after the bruarchi install - Login as the user. 

4.) Run `hyprland` from shell.
